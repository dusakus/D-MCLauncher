  2. coder is allowed to do anything with the code and publish edited version (remember to write information that it's based on the project, and provide link to the project's website). coder is also allowed to change the licence but the creator must be able to acces source of edited version.
  3. contributors are always welcome, and their help too, but remember that if you are contributing to the project your code is owned by the creator.
  4. all contributors must be listed in special file included in the project.
